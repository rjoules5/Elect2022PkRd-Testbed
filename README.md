# ORMSware Revival & NETrans Diagnostics

This repository documents the revival and calibration of ORMSware — a proprietary modeling system built for unconstrained simulation using visual logic, textual transformation, and executable precision. It serves as a living archive for technical stewardship, model diagnostics, and collaborative clarity.

## Architecture Overview

- **ORMSware**: The full modeling system, integrating Visio-based visual logic with Fortran-powered simulation.
- **NETrans**: The translator that converts Visio-exported XML into editable text files for model logic and calibration.
- **Nmod**: A suite of supplemental routines and utilities (to be added) that complete the model’s construction and execution.

## Contents

- `/models` — ORMSware Visio diagrams and simulation artifacts
- `/executables` — NETrans.EXE versions and related utilities
- `/logs` — Execution logs, compile outputs, and ribbon reports
- `/tests` — Controlled test cases for XML parsing, memory sync, and model behavior

## Philosophy

ORMSware was never meant to replace programming — it was designed to *amplify* it. By treating Fortran as a macro language and integrating visual logic, ORMSware offers both rapid formulation and deep control. It’s a system built for modelers who want to teach, trace, and preserve their logic — not just run it.
